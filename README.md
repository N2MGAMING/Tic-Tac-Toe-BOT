# XO Game

Welcome to XO Game! This is a simple command-line implementation of the popular tic-tac-toe game. You will play as "X" against a computer opponent ("O") in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3 or above).
2. Clone this repository or download the source code files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the game:
```python xo_game.py```

## Instructions

1. You will be prompted to enter your moves by specifying the coordinates of the grid cells. The grid is labeled with letters (A, B, C) for rows and numbers (1, 2, 3) for columns.
2. Enter your move by typing the corresponding cell's coordinates (e.g., A1, B2, C3) and press Enter.
3. The computer opponent will automatically make its move after you. The moves are determined by a simple algorithm.
4. The game will continue until one player wins, or it ends in a draw.
5. The winner (either Player 1 or the computer) will be displayed, or a draw message will be shown.

## Program Structure

The program consists of the following files:

- `xo_game.py`: The main Python script that contains the game logic and user interface.
- `bot.py`: A module that defines the BOT class, which handles the computer opponent's moves.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the game and instructions for running it.

## Acknowledgments

This game implementation was created as a fun project. It demonstrates basic Python programming concepts and serves as an introduction to building command-line games.

Have fun playing the XO Game! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
